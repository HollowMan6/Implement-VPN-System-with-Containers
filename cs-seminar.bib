abstract = {{Virtualization is used in data center and cloud environments to decouple applications from the hardware they run on. Hardware virtualization and operating system level virtualization are two prominent technologies that enable this. Containers, which use OS virtualization, have recently surged in interest and deployment. In this paper, we study the differences between the two virtualization technologies. We compare containers and virtual machines in large data center environments along the dimensions of performance, manageability and software development.We evaluate the performance differences caused by the different virtualization technologies in data center environments where multiple applications are running on the same servers (multi-tenancy). Our results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads. We also evaluate differences in the management frameworks which control deployment and orchestration of containers and VMs. We show how the different capabilities exposed by the two virtualization technologies can affect the management and development of applications. Lastly, we evaluate novel approaches which combine hardware and OS virtualization.}},

abstract = {{In Fog-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks, Fog computing offers great promises to achieve efficient task processing among IoT devices and the Cloud with lower processing delay and a lighter bandwidth burden. However, the sustainability of these networks is critical so that Fog servers efficiently allocate/offload increasing task types to appropriate resources. In this paper, a novel task offloading scheme called Task Offloading Scheme with P4 (TOS-P4) is proposed for Fog-based IoT networks using Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4) technology. The proposed scheme is evaluated through an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) application scenario and compared to a conventional model called Task Offloading Scheme with Software-Defined Networking controller (TOS-SDN). In this scenario, the network traffic is regulated by P4, allowing task offload decisions to be more flexible and programmable according to server loads and predetermined forwarding rules. We present the applicability of the proposed task offloading scheme in the Fog-based IoT network and its benefits to network performance in terms of latency and computation overhead. According to the experimental results, when the servers’ load status is measured at 5 s intervals, TOS-P4 is 6.54 times more efficient than TOS-SDN in waiting times of tasks received at Resource Poor (RP) Fog servers. Also, in TOS-SDN case, the average waiting time of a task on RP Fog servers is 30 times more compared to Resource Rich (RR) Fog servers.}}
